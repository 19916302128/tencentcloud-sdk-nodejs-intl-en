    /**
     * This API is used to enable On-Cloud MixTranscoding and specify the layout position of each channel of video image in the mixed video image.

There may be multiple channels of audio/video streams in a TRTC room. You can call this API to request the Tencent Cloud server to combine multiple channels of video images into one channel, specify the position of each channel, and mix the multiple channels of audio so as to output one channel of audio/video stream for easier recording and live streaming.

You can use this API to perform the following operations:
- Set image and audio quality parameters of the final live stream, including video resolution, video bitrate, video frame rate, and audio quality.
- Set the image layout, i.e., positions of all channels of images. You only need to set the layout once when enabling On-Cloud MixTranscoding, and the layout engine will automatically arrange the video images in the configured layout in subsequent operations.
- Set the recording file name for future playback.
- Set the CDN live stream ID for live streaming over CDN.

Currently, On-Cloud MixTranscoding supports the following layout templates:
- Floating template: the entire screen is covered by the video image of the first user who enters the room, and the video images of other users are displayed as small images in horizontal rows in the bottom-left corner in room entry sequence. The screen can accommodate up to 4 rows of 4 small images, which float over the big image. Up to 1 big image and 15 small images are supported. If a user sends audio only, the user will still occupy an image spot.
- Grid template: the screen is divided into user video images with the same dimensions. The more the users, the smaller the image dimensions. Up to 16 images are supported. If a user sends audio only, the user will still occupy an image spot.
- Screen sharing template: this is designed for video conferencing and online classes. The shared screen (or camera of the lecturer) is shown as the big image and always takes up the left half of the screen, and the video images of other users are displayed in the right half in up to 2 columns with up to 8 small images in each column. Up to 1 big image and 15 small images are supported. If the aspect ratio of the upstream image doesnâ€™t match that of the output image, the big image on the left will be scaled so as to be displayed in whole, and the small images on the right will be cropped.
- Picture-in-picture template: this is designed for mixing a pair of big/small images or a big image with the audio of other users. The small image floats over the big image, and the users in the big/small images and the display position of the small image can be specified. Up to 2 images are supported.
- Custom template: this is designed for specifying the image positions of users in the mixed stream or presetting image positions. If users are assigned to preset image positions, the layout engine will reserve the positions for the users; if not, users will occupy the positions in room entry sequence. If a user sends audio only, the user will still occupy an image spot, which shows the background. When all preset positions are occupied, the audio and video of other users will no longer be mixed.

Note: only applications created on or after January 9, 2020 can call this API. Those created before use the LVB stream mix by default. If you want to switch to MCU On-Cloud MixTranscoding, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
